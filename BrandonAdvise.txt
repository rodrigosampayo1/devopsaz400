I would suggest you start making demo systems.

Put yourself into a situation where you setup a repo, add a pipeline, build some infra using Terraform and then automate it. 
Get it working locally, then start making your cloud env, then last step is to build pipelines.

I don't have suggestions for sites, as I don't keep up. Docker tutorials, terraform tutorials, and Gitlab tutorials.. start cherry picking.. 
it will be determined by how you best learn. I'll help if you are stuck, or want some projects to do/ideas for projects.

For docker, build an nginx dokerfile that displays a hello world. 
Learn how to build, how to configure, starting the container, checking the process, accessing the website in it, removing the container, 
updating the container with a new image. Managing images, i.e. pulling and pushing the dockerfile and examples to gitlab container registry. 
Learn about what tags are and how they are used.


You can do a lot with a little.. then there are a bunch or scenarios to begin learning about.. what it can do.
 Later once you have docker down, I will help you learn Kubernetes.. which is docker with advanced configurations.
