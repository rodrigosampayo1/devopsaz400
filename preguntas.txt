-- Deployment groups: Its a logical set of deployment target machines that have agents.
These represent the physical environments, for example Dev, Prod and Test environment. 
So, a deployment group is just another grouping of AGENTS, much like an agent ppol.
Deployment groups are ONLY available with CLASSIC RELEASE PIPELINES (diferente a YAML Pipeline)

-- Variables: to define  a value that you can then use in your pipeline; these are stored as strings and mutable
These can change from run to run OR job to job of your pipeline.
Trabajan con scope y si esta definida en Stage, pisa las de jobs. Es decir,
->When you define the same variable in multiple places with same name, the most locally scoped variable wins.
You can add variables to variables groups.

-- Variables groups: Store values and secrets that you might want to be passed into a YAML pipeline,
or make available across multiple pipelines.
You can share and use variable groups in multiple pipelines in the same project.
Also, secret variables in "variables groups" are PROTECTED RESOURCES, and can add combinations of aprrovals,
checks, and pipeline permissions to limit access to 'secret variables' in a 'variable group'.

-- Protected resources: agents pools, secret variables in variable groups, secure files, service connections,
environments, repositories.
Protected is because is for specific users and project; and you can ADD approvals and checks.

-- Secure File: (On pipelines-Library)
This give you a way to store files that you can share ACROSS pipelines, this files are used to store:
'signing certificates','apple provisioning profiles', 'android keystore files', 'ssh keys'.
The files can be stored on the server without having to COMMIT them to your repository.
The size limit for each secure file is 10MB.


--Targets on CI:
--Targets on CD:



--A trigger tells a Pipeline to run.
--A pipeline is made up of one or more stages. A pipeline can deploy to one or more environments.
--A stage is a way of organizing jobs in a pipeline and each stage can have one or more jobs.
--Each job runs on one agent. A job can also be agentless.
--Each agent runs a job that contains one or more steps.
--A step can be a task or script and is the smallest building block of a pipeline.
--A task is a pre-packaged script that performs an action, such as invoking a REST API or publishing a build artifact.
--An artifact is a collection of files or packages published by a run.
